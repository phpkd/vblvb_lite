	          - Which posts do you wish to check against dead links? You can choose between checking "All Posts" or checking only "First Post from each thread".
	          - Options: [None | All Posts (Thread's First Post + All Replies) | First Post Only (Only Thread's First Post)]

	     o New Posts: What to check?
	          - Which new posts do you wish to check against dead links? You can choose between checking "All New Posts" or checking only "New Threads" (thread's header, without replies).
	          - Options: [None | All New Posts (Threads & Replies) | Only New Threads (Just Thread's Header/First Post)]

	          - Which edited posts do you wish to check against dead links? You can choose between checking "All Edited Posts" or checking only "Edited Threads" (thread's header, without replies).
	          - Options: [None | All Edited Posts (Threads & Replies) | Only Edited Threads (Just Thread's Header/First Post)]

	     o Maximum Links to check per post
	          - How many links do you wish to check per post? If any post contains more than that defined limit, then those 'over limit' links will be ignored & will not be checked; only the first X links (as defined here) will be checked against dead links. Enter "0" for UNLIMITED.

	     o Critical Limit/Red Line
	          - Checked posts may contain dead links, you can control when posts should be punished because of high percentage of dead links within it. Just enter the Red Line percentage here as a positive integer value (without any symbols). This critical Limit/Red Line is the maximum percentage that dead links can represent from all links available per post.
	          - Examples: If you enter "10", that means 10% only of dead links allowed per post (And 90% alive), if that post contains more than that percentage of dead links from all links, then it will be flagged; this way it can be punished by the way you specify in the settings below. If the post has less than 10% of dead links then it will pass as valid without punishment.
	          - Please note that "0" means that all links per post should be valid & alive (no dead links allowed, if just one link is dead the post will be flagged); While "100" means the opposite, it means that all links per post should be dead to be flagged, that means if there is only one link alive & the rest are dead, the post will pass as valid without punishment.
	          - Note Also: If any post has only 5 links within it to be checked, then that means each link represents 20% from the whole checked links. This means also if only one link is dead & you've set this setting to '10%' the expression will evaluate as true & will punish that post since it has 20% dead links.

	     o Check Succession Period
	          - You can determine the separating time period between successive checks for same posts, so those "checked recently" posts don't be checked every time the script runs. If you wish you can force posts to be checked multiple times, but with at least 1 day between each two successive checks. Enter how many days you wish to separate each two successive checks here, or enter "0" to disable this feature. Note: "7" means your posts will be checked every seven days, those checked posts will not be checked again before seven days has been passed from the last check, "0" means that checked posts will be checked just once. A Higher Value usually recommended specially for large boards.

	     o Posts To Check in Each Batch
	          - Commonly, it's recommended to set a specific number of posts to process in each turn to prevent any possible timeout or Memory/CPU exhausting during the execution process. A Lower Value usually recommended specially for boards that has long posts containing many links. There's other important factors that have strong affect also such as: [COLOR="DarkRed"Time/Date Cutoff Mode" & "Time/Date Cutoff Value", "Existing Posts: Which posts to check?", "Maximum Links to check per post", "Check Succession Period"[/COLOR]; So please take care & try to set a logical value for each of these settings/options or you may result in unexpected results; Such as checking only the first X number of posts in the forum & re-check them again without shifting to other posts. You're the one who knows your board & you're the one who can determine which suits you & your board according to your board's activity/content/requirements. Enter "0" for UNLIMITED!

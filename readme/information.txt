	     o Check Existing Posts
	          - Should existing posts be checked? If yes, then which of it should be? Only thread's head (first post), or all posts within?
	          - Turning this option 'OFF' means that the scheduled task (cronjob) will be completely useless, it will not do any work at all. Only new & edited posts will be checked if activated in the following settings.
	          - Options: [None | All Posts | Thread's First Post]

	          - Turning this option 'OFF' means that the scheduled task (cronjob) will be completely useless, it will not do any work at all. Only new & edited posts will be checked if activated in the following settings.
	          - Options: [None | All Posts | Thread's First Post]

	     o Check Edited Posts (Ultimate Edition Only)
	          - Should edited posts be checked live (on real time)? If yes, then which of it should be? Only thread's head (first post), or all replies as well?
	          - Turning this option 'ON' may cause users with low/limited internet connections to have some issues and may not be able to post, specially if their post contains many links to be checked.
	          - Options: [None | All Posts | Thread's First Post]

	     o Maximum Checked Links Per Post
	          - How many links should be checked per post? If any post contains more than that defined limit, then those 'over limit' links will be ignored & will not be checked; only the first X links (as defined here) will be checked. Enter "0" for UNLIMITED.

	     o Critical Limit/Red Line
	          - Posts can be punished because of high percentage of dead links within. Define the "Critical Limit/Red Line" percentage here as a positive integer value (without any symbols). This "Critical Limit/Red Line" is the percentage that if dead links reaches or exceeded within a post, then that post will be punished.
	          - Notes & Examples:
		+ "10" means if dead links within a post reaches or exceeded 10% of all included links it will be punished. If a post has less than 10% of dead links, then it will pass as valid without punishment.
		+ "0" means that all links per post should be valid & alive (no dead links allowed, if just one link is dead the post will be punished); While "100" means the opposite, it means that all links within a post should be dead to be punished, that means if there is only one link alive & the rest are dead, the post will pass as valid without punishment.
		+ If any post has only 5 links within it to be checked, that means each link represents 20% from all checked links. It means also if only one link is dead & you have set this setting to '10%' the expression will evaluate as true & will punish that post since it has 20% of dead links.


	     o Check Succession Period
	          - Successive checks for same posts can be separated by a certain period of time, so those 'checked recently' posts did not checked every time the script runs. Same posts can be checked multiple times, but with at least 1 day between each two successive checks. Define how many days should separate each two successive checks for the same post, or enter "0" to check posts ONLY ONCE. Note: "14" means your checked posts will be checked again every fourteen days (two weeks). "0" or a high Value usually recommended specially for large boards.

	     o Checked Posts Per Batch
	          - It is recommended to define a specific low number of posts to process in each run to prevent any possible timeout or Memory/CPU exhausting during the execution process. A Lower Value usually recommended specially for boards that has long posts with many links. There is other important factors that have strong affect as well such as: "Time/Date Cutoff Mode", "Time/Date Cutoff Value", "Check existing posts", "Maximum Checked Links Per Post", "Check Succession Period"; So please take care & try to set a logical acceptable value for each of these settings to avoid any expected/unexpected issues. You are the best one who knows your board & you are the one who can determine which suits you & your board according to your board's activity/content/requirements.
